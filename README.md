# Network: Django and Javascript
### Homework from [Harvard's Web Programming with Python and Javascript CS50W hosted on eDX](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-web-programming-with-python-and-javascript)
### ðŸŽ“ [Project 4](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/projects/4/network/)
- Network: Built a Twitter-like social network website for making posts and following users. Went beyond requirements by building a RESTful API in Django and building the front-end as a single-page web app.
- I wrote all the code in this repository.

## ðŸ’¡Lessons Learned
- Building a RESTful API in vanilla Django (without the help libraries)
- Using vanilla Javascript to build the front-end of a single-page web application
- Using Javascript `fetch` to make API calls to a Django RESTful API
